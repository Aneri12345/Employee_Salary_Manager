# Employee_Salary_Manager
The project includes the basic concepts of JAVA application: 
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Threading.
There are total two categories of employees: sales and production.
The manager will input number of employees and the required details for the employees.
The program will calculate and print the required salary to be paid including the bonus (if required). 
To access the total salary, the program will ask for a password for basic security purpose, here the password is "123". 
It is followed by a simple application of threading, used to maintain a counter. The user must enter "s" and the enter key to stop the counter. 
This ends the program with printing the properly sequenced salaries of each employe.
